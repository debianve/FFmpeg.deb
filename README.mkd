FFmpeg.deb
==========

This is FFmpeg's debianization sources. The package was created because
Debian now is shipped with Libav instead of FFmpeg, and as they're from
different upstream maintainers there are some differences in functions.

How to Install
--------------

First, clone this repository:
		$ git clone git://github.com/ghostbar/FFmpeg.deb.git

Now checkout `pristine-tar` and `upstream` branches, fetch all tags and you now can use `git-buildpackage` to compile:
		$ git checkout -t -b pristine-tar origin/pristine-tar
		$ git checkout -t -b upstream origin/upstream
		$ git fetch --tags
		$ git checkout master
		$ git-buildpackage
